## Goal

Understand the eco-system of software plugins and mods, attempting to understand
what it takes to build an _open core_ system, for example a messaging framework
which enables users to bring their own data and behavior.

## History of Video Game Modding

[great overview](https://www.techradar.com/news/skins-smurfs-and-skyrim-a-brief-history-of-pc-modding)

There seems to be a common pattern where bleeding edge technology moves from games to start ups to enterprise and extensible software is no different.
One of the first examples of consumers modifying software is the Wolfenstein 3D smurf mode released 1983 [^smurfmod]. These consumers searched the Wolfenstein codebase and found the location of various assets and modified them.John Carmack, a developer at ID software, saw that modding extended the lifetime of Wolfenstein so when Doom was released the developers attempted to support modding out of the box [^smurfmod]. Doom separated the game engine from game data such as levels/graphics. This data was stored in a WAD file which means "Where's all the Data"? Users were essentially encouraged to change the game by changing the data in the WAD file [^wikigamemod]. Separating data from the execution became essential for modding video games in the future [^observabledata].

Developers soon started releasing mod tools along with their games, such as UnrealEd created by Tim Sweeney [^unrealed]. User generated content sometimes became more popular than the original game itself, for example Minh Le's modification of Half-Life into Counter Strike [^counterstrike] or the DayZ modification of Arma 2. Other games became popular in no small part due to the massive eco system of mods that developed around them such as GTA IV, Skyrim, and Minecraft.

- Open Questions
  - what makes some games more amenable to modding than others?
    - skyrim has a creation kit released by bethesda [^creationkit]
    - GTA IV and Minecraft modding communities developed without the support of the game creators. However Minecraft mods were embraced and the most prolific mod creators were hired to develop an official API for modding.

## History of Software Modding

Outside of video games, software mods first appeared in the 70s but became popular with the release of HyperCard and QuarkXPress on Mac in 1987 [^wikiplugin]. Creative software started to include mods with the release of Digital Darkroom and SuperPaint from Silicon Beach Software in 1988 [^wikiplugin]. Photoshop 2.0 included support for 3rd party plugins in 1991 [^wikiphotoshopplugin] and in 1994 Pro Tools (Audio) was released with support for third party plugins [^protools].

It is interesting to note that a lot of plugins started in the creative tools community.
These communities share a commonality where users are trying to _express themselves_ through software. The additional functionality provided through third-party plugins can become part of the users' identity through their creative output.

More recently software has begun to be developed with the explicit purpose of being extended. Vscode is a good example of this[^vscodereadme]. All of the built in language support in vscode is provided by extensions. Other good examples are NeoVim where [the GUI itself is a plugin](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Plugin-UI-architecture).

We can think of these pieces of software as an "extensible core" where the bulk of functionality is provided by "extensions" which are orchestrated in a cohesive way by a smaller "core".

[^vscodereadme]: You can see the [first example of extensions in the vscode readme](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/160d58dba78b9acca7d8f9fb629ae17b496a68a7/README.md#L5) show up in the first couple of months of development by which point they already had implemented extensions for 20+ languages.

- Open Questions
  - What design decisions go into building software with an extensible core?
  - What types of software are conducive to an extensible core model?
