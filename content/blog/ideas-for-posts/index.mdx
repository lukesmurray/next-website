## What is the future of the web?

- As local first software becomes more popular, we've started to run into the limits of performance.
  Keeping track of and merging collaborative changes can be memory and cpu intensive, potentially limiting the types of software that can be developed with a local first paradigm.
  Does streaming your browser through the cloud offer a potential solution[^mightybrowser] [^stadia]?
  [^mightybrowser]: [Mighty](https://www.mightyapp.com/) is a browser which runs in the cloud and streams the GUI to your device, moving the memory and CPU load to the server.
  [^stadia]: [Stadia](https://stadia.google.com/) is a cloud based game service which allows you to play games on low power devices by moving memory and CPU load to the cloud.
- XR, 3d applications

    - postgres with real time subscriptions
  - replicache
    - replicated key value store
  - hasura
    - postgres database with graphql and subscriptions
  - liveblocks
    - apis and tools for building real time collaborative projects

  - [database in the browser](https://stopa.io/post/279)
  - Automerge
  - yjs
  - faster crdts https://josephg.com/blog/crdts-go-brrr/
- declarative type generation and client-server communication
  - related to [database in the browser](https://stopa.io/post/279)
  - uis will continue to be generated from state but queries to generate that state will be declarative and implemented with query optimizers

## How could we improve teaching computer science?

- We don't learn how to publish or share software in school [^ifatreefalls].
  Maybe because this process is constantly changing and rapidly outdated, or maybe because most software engineers will contribute to companies which have internal processes for packaging software.
  But learning how to package, share, and reuse software is imperative if you want to share your code with other people.

  [^ifatreefalls]:
      The [philosophical thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest) ""If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" is relevant here.
      If we don't know how to package and share software who will be able to use it?

## Can we build p2p web applications without a central server?

- Can we build a site where multiple people visiting the site can communicate with eachother without requiring a central server to maintain those connections?
  - The answer is no. You need a centralized server to set up the initial connections.

## What are the core ingredients needed to build end user extensible software?

- See [why figma wins](https://kwokchain.com/2020/06/19/why-figma-wins/) as an example of this
- Other examples of incredible ecosystems are [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery), [atom](https://atom.io/packages), and probably the least obvious but most pervase...unix.
