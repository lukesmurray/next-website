I fell in love with computer science because it was a tremendously enjoyable way to procrastinate doing my math homework.
Over the years I've battled my urge to procrastinate, building lists and keeping myself on strict habit regiments.
But I've come to terms with the fact that the procrastination will continue.
Hopefully this site can serve as a record of my constant side projects and explorations.

To get things started here is a visualization I made of cities in the US.
You can type city names and see where certain prefixes are more common.
