- a ton of my phd research involves building interfaces in typescript
- over the past year I've often found myself frustrated by the state of algorithm libraries in javascript
- many algorithm libraries are [pedagogical](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms), [stagnant](https://github.com/mauriciosantos/Buckets-JS), or [slow to develop](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/mnemonist).
- a lot of my algorithm work involves string parsing, Aho Corasick, compressed tries.
  - these algorithms wouldn't fit into existing libraries very well
- so i decided to write my own algorithm library
- why do this?
  - writing your own algorithm library is an amazing pedagogical experience for yourself
  - I can build on top of the algorithm library

- when I have issues I can resolve them instantly, all the code is mine
