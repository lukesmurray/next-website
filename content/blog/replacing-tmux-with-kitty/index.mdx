I recently decided to switch my terminal from iTerm to Kitty.
Kitty is simply faster, much nicer to my battery, and more fun to work with since a lot of the internals are hackable with end user scripts.

In my last post I wrote about [replicating iTerm's quake-like dropdown functionality](../quake-applications-for-mac/) using [Phoenix](https://github.com/kasper/phoenix), a scriptable window manager for macOS.
In this post I'll show how I replicated a bunch of the behavior from [gpakosz's famous tmux config](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) using native Kitty.
If you absolutely must have persistent sessions and daemons then you'll need to wait for [those to be implemented in kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/391).
But in the meantime you can replicate 90% of the pane and window behavior from gpakosz's config with just a few additions to your kitty config.
At the end you'll have a snappy terminal which has much nicer [energy and performance](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/391#issuecomment-638320745).

The final kitty config files (which you can place in `~/.config/kitty`) can be found [here](https://github.com/lukesmurray/bootstrap/tree/75b51d1/.config/kitty).
