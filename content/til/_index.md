Since starting this site a lot of my learning has transferred over to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
Information is a lot easier to access in your brain than on your website.
Also remembering something with Anki for the rest of your life takes between [1-2 minutes](https://controlaltbackspace.org/memory/how-much-to-learn-with-anki/).

You can check out my [anki decks](https://github.com/lukesmurray/anki) —written as markdown files– and the program I use to [synchronize them to anki](https://github.com/lukesmurray/markdown-anki-decks).
