Today I was profiling an application which uses autocomplete and I noticed that in the chrome dev tools it said ther ewas a forced layout occuring.

Turns out many of the javascript APIs which ask for the size or location of a DOM element will cause the browser to synchronously calculate the style and layout. [Paul Irish has an excellent list of most of these methods](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a)

In my case I am positioning a dropdown based on the current [window selection's](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection) [range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range). Whenever the user types a character I call `range.getBoundingClientRect()` which is triggering a layout reflow in the browser.

I don't have a great solution for this yet but I did find one other place in my application that was triggering forced layouts.

If you use [tippyjs](https://github.com/atomiks/tippyjs) or [popperjs](https://github.com/popperjs/popper-core) then you may ant to set your [boundary](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/utils/detect-overflow/#boundary) to `"viewport"`.
The default is to use `"clippingParents"` which will cause a layout to occur.
