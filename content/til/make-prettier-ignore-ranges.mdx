I used [prettier-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to keep my code consistently formatted.
I also have VSCode automatically format my code on save.
This is super nice because when I make changes I don't need to worry about creating weird diffs due to small formatting changes.
I simply save and get something which looks good enough.

```json
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
```

## Problem

Sometimes I have code which I don't want prettier to change.
For example in my post [Fuzzy search Json Files](./fuzzy-search-json-file.md) I have some exmaple json which is purposefully minified.
Prettier tries to be super helpful and unminmize the json for me whenever I save.
Sometimes I work around this issue by executing the vscode command _Save without Formatting_ (`cmd + k s`) but that can get tedious if you're working in a file that is being changed quite a bit.

## Solution

Prettier supports [disabling formatting for ranges using html comments](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html#range-ignore)!

````md
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```json
{"my": "minimized", "json": "object"}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
````
