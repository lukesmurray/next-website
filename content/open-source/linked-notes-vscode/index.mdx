[Linked-Notes-Vscode](https://github.com/lukesmurray/linked-notes-vscode) is a [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension that seeks to emulate some of [Roam Research](https://www.roamresearch.com/)'s features.
When I first started using Roam I found the experience to be a bit frustrating.
While I loved the ability to create a richly linked network of notes I found the lack of things like autocomplete, vim, keyboard shortcuts, and split panes to be a pain. I also wanted to see how far I could push VSCode.

The original extension was inspired by very early work on [vscode-markdown-notes](https://github.com/kortina/vscode-markdown-notes) created by [Andrew Kortina](https://kortina.nyc) and [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/)'s [note-link-janitor](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor).
