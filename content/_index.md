# Welcome ðŸ‘‹!

My name is Luke and I am currently a PhD candidate at MIT working in [David Karger's](http://people.csail.mit.edu/karger/) [Haystack group](http://haystack.csail.mit.edu/)!

My current research interest is building note taking systems for doctors in the Emergency Room. My tools have been used in live Emergency Room settings to take notes on over 1000 patients!

In the past I interned at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) in the [EPIC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/epic/) group, at [Google](https://www.google.com/) on the [Data Commons](https://datacommons.org/) team, and at [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) on the data science team.

While in undergrad I led [Andries van Dam's](https://cs.brown.edu/people/avandam/) graphics lab. As the team lead I took charge of the first year of development of [Dash](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3372923.3404807), a hypermedia system focused around documents.
